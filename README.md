# Secure-Sonic-WAN

A next-generation Zero Trust WAN architecture leveraging SONiC, IPv6, and open-source networking components.

## Overview

Secure-Sonic-WAN is a proof-of-concept architecture for building secure, scalable, and cost-effective Wide Area Networks using:

- **SONiC** (Software for Open Networking in the Cloud) as the network operating system
- **IPv6-native design** eliminating NAT and enabling global addressability
- **Zero Trust principles** with identity-based access control
- **Containerized services** for tunneling (ZeroTier, WireGuard), identity (IAM), and policy enforcement (OPA)
- **Commodity hardware** (white-box uCPE) for vendor independence

## Key Features

- **Identity-driven networking**: Devices and users authenticate via IAM, not by IP or VLAN
- **Micro-segmentation**: Policy enforcement at every edge node
- **Outbound-only connections**: Minimal attack surface with encrypted tunnels
- **Built for IoT and Industrial**: Optimized for factory automation, renewable energy parks, and distributed edge deployments
- **Open source foundation**: Built entirely on community-driven software

## Architecture Principles

1. **IPv6 Everywhere** - Native end-to-end connectivity without NAT
2. **Zero Trust Security** - Never trust, always verify
3. **Modular Design** - Clean separation between data plane (SONiC) and control plane (containers)
4. **Hardware Independence** - Runs on x86/ARM white-label appliances
5. **Automation First** - Infrastructure as Code for deployment and management

## Documentation

- [Full Technical Specification](./secure-sonic-wan.md) 
   - Comprehensive architecture document including:
    - System components and integration

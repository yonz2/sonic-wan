                      This represents the ISPs Internet connection and the Zerotier Termination node 
                      Some traffic will be routed directly from here to the internet (e.g. Traffic to the 'Microsoft Front Door'),
                      Real Internet traffic will be routed to a tunnel towards a 'Secure Web Gateway' (SWG)
                      The ZeroTier (ZT) Tunnel (or other similar Technlogy) will also terminate here. 
                      The Inter-Site Office (VLAN=10) and Production (VLAN=20) traffic will be routed through the ZT Tunnel.
                      Other VLANs don't need to be routed through the ZT Tunnel. (Guest goes to the SWG and IOT is just local, 
                      with a potential restricted acces to the SWG (to get SW upadtes)

  # Site 1
    # VLAN 01: Guest Network (default)  - IP address  10.1.1.0/24

    # VLAN 30: IoT Devices              - IP address  10.2.30.0/24
  # Note:
  # 
# routing and firewalling will be done on the core switches. Following rules will be required:
  #   1) Inter-VLAN routing will be disabled on the access switches
  #   2) The Core Switches will route traffic between the VLANs
  #   3) The Core Switches will route traffic to the Internet via a policy based rules:
  #       IF traffic is destined for the 'Microsoft Front Door': routed directly to the Internet
  #       ELSE: traffic will be routed to a Secure Web Gateway (SWG) via a SWG Tunnel
  #   4) The Core Switches will route traffic between the sites via a ZeroTrust Tunnel (VLANS 10 and 20)

# Layer 3 Services (DHCP, DNS, NTP, etc.) will be provided by the Core Switches. (Note: This 'Container-Lab' uses static IPs)
# DHCP Addresses will be assigned based on the VLAN ID. Only VLANs 01 and 10 will get Dynamic Addresses.
# The Core Switches will also provide the default gateway for the VLANs.
